SAML requires a X.509 cert to sign and encrypt elements like NameID, Message, Assertion, Metadata.

If our environment requires sign or encrypt support, the certs folder may contain the X.509 cert and the private key
that the SP will use:

sp.crt The public cert of the SP
sp.key The private key of the SP
Or also we can provide those data in the setting file at the x509cert and the privateKey JSON parameters of the sp element.

Sometimes we could need a signature on the metadata published by the SP, in this case we could use the X.509 cert previously mentioned or use a new X.509 cert: metadata.crt and metadata.key.

Use sp_new.crt if you are in a key rollover process and you want to publish that X.509 certificate on Service Provider metadata.
